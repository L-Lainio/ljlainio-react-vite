Utlizing open-source to create this personal profiel for myself.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Description

As a web developer, I understand the importance of being part of a community. I need a platform to showcase my projects, not just for job applications or freelance work, but also to collaborate with fellow developers and share my work.

React Challenge: React Portfolio Having completed various projects, my current task is to develop a portfolio using my new React skills to stand out from other developers who may not be using the latest technologies.
For this module challenge, I will deploy this application to Netlify. I will follow the instructions provided in activity 27-Evr_Git-Deploy to create a build that I can deploy.

The task involves creating a React portfolio to showcase projects and skills, enabling collaboration with other developers. The portfolio must be deployed on Netlify and meet specific acceptance criteria. Employers can view the portfolio to assess candidates' skills in building single-page applications. The portfolio should include sections like About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with specific features like navigation, project images with links, a contact form, and links to social profiles.

## Technologies-Used

The technologies used in this project include:

React for building the single-page application
Netlify for deployment
HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the portfolio
JavaScript for interactivity and functionality
GitHub for version control and hosting the code repository

## React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

As a web developer, being part of the community is key. You’ll create a unique portfolio using React to showcase your projects, making you stand out in job applications and freelance opportunities. This portfolio will be deployed to Netlify, giving potential employers a live view of your work.

User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
...
(The detailed criteria can be found in the project documentation, ensuring a comprehensive review of your portfolio features.)

Mock-Up
Here’s a quick look at how your portfolio will function:

User clicks through About Me, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact sections on the webpage and enters information on Contact page.

Getting Started
Set Up Your Portfolio: Use vite to build your portfolio, which will include:

A Header component for consistent navigation.
A Navigation component using Link from react-router-dom.
Multiple instances of a Project component in the Portfolio section.
A Footer component linking to your social profiles.
Scaffold Your Vite Application:

Open your command line.
Run npm create vite, and follow the prompts to set up your React project.
Install dependencies with npm install.
Launch your development server with npm run dev.
Further Customization (Recommended)
Update package.json: Modify the scripts section for easier commands: json "scripts": { "dev": "vite", "start": "vite", "build": "vite build", "lint": "eslint src --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0", "preview": "vite preview" },

Edit vite.config.js: Ensure your configuration supports your preferred settings: js export default defineConfig({ plugins: [react()], server: { port: 3000, open: true } });

Deployment
Follow Netlify's deployment guide to deploy your application live. This will allow employers to view your work in action.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance while building your portfolio! Happy coding! 🎉
